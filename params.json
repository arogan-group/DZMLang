(Lexer, Evaluator, Printer)\r\n* Contains basic types: Chars, Numbers, Strings, Symbols, Procedures and compounds, Pairs, I/O handles.\r\n* Support for procedures added via simple API. (add_proc)\r\n* Basic I/O operations. (write-char, read-char, read, write, peek, open, close, ...)\r\n* ~~Garbage Collector. (WIP)~~\r\n* Standard Library. (WIP)\r\n* Uses R5RS language specification.\r\n* Compatible with various others scripts written for different interpreters. (TLC, SICP-esque interpreters)\r\n\r\n## Build Instructions\r\n* On Windows\r\n   * Install latest version of MinGW GCC compiler\r\n   * Use build.bat to compile project\r\n   * **NOTE**: ctime.exe is a time-tracking utility which measures build times for me. ctime.exe was developed by [Casey Muratori](https://twitter.com/cmuratori), more info about ctime.exe utility can be found here: [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdMHyGxfg6U).\r\n* On Linux and Mac OS X\r\n   * Make sure you have the latest stable version of G++/clang++ compiler installed.\r\n   * Make sure you have the latest version of **libreadline6** and **libreadline6-dev** installed (if applicable).\r\n   * `make` in project folder.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n*  **Hal Abelson's, Jerry Sussman's and Julie Sussman's Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs** (MIT Press, 1984; ISBN 0-262-01077-1; known as SICP) book.\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\n* DZMLang is licensed under the **Apache 2 License**, see LICENSE for more information.\r\n",
